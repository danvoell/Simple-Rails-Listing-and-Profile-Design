Simple-Rails-Listing-and-Profile-Design
=======================================

This is meant to be a very basic template for Rails Applications which includes a landing page (index) that functions as a list and a well designed show (show) page which profiles each entry on the list. It is open source. Please help contribute as I am just a beginner. 

The reason for starting this is that although I love Twitter Bootstrap and Rails scaffolds, they are both way too generic and barebones. I want to create an out of the box app that you can craft your next Job Listing site, or Groupon, or Video Voting site, or Blog, or Flippa Clone ...

The basic goal is a simple listing page with multiple:
Photo or video of some sort
A Title
A Description
Date

When the listing is clicked this leads to a "show" page with:
A larger version of the photo or video
A larger version of the title
A description
Comments

Beyond this functionality, it would be cool if we could create seperate branches or forks with different designs of the common template that anyone could access. I am new to Github and not sure how that would work.
