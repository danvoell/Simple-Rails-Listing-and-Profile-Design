Simple-Rails-Listing-and-Profile-Design
=======================================

Basic template for Ruby on Rails list type applications. Includes index and show page styles for quick start. Demo Available AT - http://vast-castle-2947.herokuapp.com/ 

The reason for starting this is that although I love Twitter Bootstrap and Rails scaffolds, they are both way too generic and barebones. I want to create an out of the box app that you can craft your next Job Listing site, or Groupon, or Video Voting site, or Blog, or Flippa Clone ...

Gems Used in this application include:

Sunspot (search)
Active_Reputation (voting)
ImageMagick and Mini_Magick (images) - NOTE YOU WILL NEED TO INSTALL IMAGEMAGICK ON YOUR COMPUTER
Acts_As_Taggable - (tagging)
Polymorphic Associations - (commenting)
Devise - (login system)

If you like this concept, please star OR help out. If we have enough interest, we can get some designers to help out.

This is what it currently looks like <br><br> <img src="http://snag.gy/MBijF.jpg">
